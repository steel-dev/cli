# Steel + OpenAI Computer Use Assistant in Python

This example shows how to integrate Steel with OpenAI's Computer Use Assistant (CUA) API to create a browser automation agent. The assistant sees the browser through Steel's cloud sessions, analyzes the screen, and performs actions like clicking, typing, and navigating.

## Prerequisites

- A Steel API key â€” [Get one here](https://app.steel.dev/settings/api-keys)
- An OpenAI API key with access to the Computer Use Assistant preview

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-cookbook
cd steel-cookbook/examples/steel-oai-computer-use-python-starter

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys:

```
STEEL_API_KEY=your_steel_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## How it Works

This example demonstrates:

1. **Creating a Steel browser session** - Launches a remote browser in the cloud
2. **Connecting with Playwright** - Establishes a direct connection to control the browser
3. **Integrating with OpenAI's Computer Use Assistant** - Sends screenshots to OpenAI and receives actions to execute
4. **Action execution** - Translates OpenAI's commands into browser actions (click, type, scroll, etc.)
5. **Continuous interaction loop** - Maintains a cycle of screenshots and actions until the task is complete

## Running the Example

Execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll be prompted to enter a task for the assistant to perform. Examples:

- "Search for Steel browser on Bing and tell me about it"
- "Find today's weather for New York City"
- "Go to Wikipedia and find information about machine learning"

The script will:

1. Create a Steel session (you'll see a URL where you can watch the session live)
2. Send the initial screenshot to OpenAI
3. Execute the commands received from OpenAI
4. Send updated screenshots after each action
5. Continue this loop until the task is complete

## Key Components

### SteelBrowser Class

A wrapper around the Steel session and Playwright browser that provides methods for:

- Creating and managing a browser session
- Taking screenshots
- Executing various browser actions (click, type, scroll, etc.)

### OpenAI Integration

The script connects to OpenAI's Computer Use Assistant API to:

- Send browser screenshots
- Receive actions to execute
- Process text responses from the assistant

## Customization

You can modify the example to:

- Change the initial URL (currently Bing.com)
- Adjust the browser dimensions
- Add more action types
- Implement additional error handling
- Customize the UI/UX of the interaction
